If you think I'm gone, I'm just doing sysopy exercises
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Don't mind me if I light up
Only need it sorta kinda

sysopy exercises

Sometimes I don't care
Sometimes I cry too
Sometimes life's a little hard to get used to
Occasionally I forget to sleep
Remind myself that I gotta eat three times a day this week
Try not to clench my teeth
Got a little OCD
Listen to the CDC when I'm feeling uneasy
