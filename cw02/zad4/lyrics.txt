Just doing some drugs
I don't wanna tell my mom I smoke this weed
I don't wanna tell my dad, he'll call me weak
I don't wanna be the blackest of the sheep
Missing their call every single week
I don't wanna say

Sometimes I do drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
drugs, can't find us
If you think I'm gone, I'm just doing drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Don't mind me if I light up
Only need it sorta kinda

Sometimes I don't care
Sometimes I cry too
Sometimes life's a little hard to get used to
Occasionally I forget to sleep
Remind myself that I gotta eat three times a day this week
Try not to clench my teeth
Got a little OCD
Listen to the CDC when I'm feeling uneasy
