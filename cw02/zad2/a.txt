O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuetide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody know a turkyy ans some mistleoe
Helps to make the seasons bright
Tiny tost with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know the Santa’s on his way
He’s loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother’s child is gonnna try
To see if reindeer really know how yo fly
And so i am offering this simpler phrase
To kids form one to 92
Although it’s been said many Times
Many ways
Marry Christmas to you
And so i am offering this simpler phrase
